The Stump Window Manager
------------------------

Stumpwm is a window manager written entirely in Common Lisp. It
attempts to be highly customizable while relying entirely on the
keyboard for input. You will not find buttons, icons, title bars, tool
bars, or any of the other conventional GUI widgets. 

These design decisions reflect the growing popularity of productive,
customizable lisp based systems.

Build & Start Stumpwm
---------------------

Prerequisites
=============

* a common lisp distribution. clisp or SBCL both worth.
* clx
* cl-ppcre

If you intend to use sbcl you need to install portable-clx. If you're
using clisp, make sure it has been compiled with mit-clx. As of clisp
1.41, new-clx is too buggy to run stumpwm. If you want to use new-clx,
build clisp from CVS where the problems have been resolved.

You can use asdf-install to install lisp libraries:
$ sbcl
* (require 'asdf)
* (require 'asdf-install)
* (asdf-install:install 'clx)
* (asdf-install:install 'cl-ppcre)

Your operating system distribution may also have these libraries
available.

Building
========

Building stumpwm from CVS requires that you build the configure script:

$ autoconf

If there's already a configure script then just run it.

$ ./configure

By default stumpwm elects sbcl. You can explicitely use clisp this way:

$ ./configure --with-lisp=clisp

If your lisps are in strange places you may need to tell the script where to find them:

$ configure --with-sbcl=/home/sabetts/opt/bin --with-clisp=/usr/local/downstairs/to/the/left

Now build it:

$ make

If all goes well, you should have a stumpwm binary now. Sorry there's
no install yet. Just copy the binary wherever you want or run it out
of the stumpwm/ directory.

Now that you have a binary, call it from your ~/.xinitrc file:

$ echo /path/to/stumpwm > ~/.xinitrc
$ startx

Hopefully that will put you in X running stumpwm!

SBCL And Threads
----------------

SBCL compiled with threads causes problems with stumpwm. The most
common is sluggishness. It may also cause stumpwm to become
unresponsive. If you use SBCL, consider using a version built without
threads.

Help
----

There's a texinfo manual, stumpwm.texi. the build scripts generate an
info file you can read in emacs or with the `info' program.

There's a #stumpwm channel on irc.freenode.net, too.

The Stump Window Manager
------------------------

Stumpwm is a window manager written entirely in Common Lisp. It
attempts to be highly customizable while relying entirely on the
keyboard for input. You will not find buttons, icons, title bars, tool
bars, or any of the other conventional GUI widgets. 

These design decisions reflect the growing popularity of productive,
customizable lisp based systems.

Installation
------------

Boot up a common lisp implementation. I test it regularily with sbcl
and clisp.

Since stumpwm has an ASDF package, load asdf (it's probably already
loaded) and run:

(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'stumpwm)

For most configurations you should be able to type the following:

(stumpwm:stumpwm)

stumpwm takes an optional argument, the DISPLAY string.

;; Here's a script that runs stumpwm using sbcl. You can put it in
;; your path and run it as a regular program. Make sure you have a
;; symlink of stumpwm.asd is your ~/.sbcl/systems/ directory or
;; another directory in asdf:*central-registry* so asdf can find
;; stumpwm.

;; If you want stumpwm to load on a specific display use the DISPLAY
;; environment variable.

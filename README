The Stump Window Manager
------------------------

Stumpwm is a window manager written entirely in Common Lisp. It
attempts to be highly customizable while relying entirely on the
keyboard for input. You will not find buttons, icons, title bars, tool
bars, or any of the other conventional GUI widgets. 

These design decisions reflect the growing popularity of productive,
customizable lisp based systems.

Installation
------------

Boot up a common lisp interpreter (I use CMUCL most of the time, but
I've tested it with SBCL as well). 

Since stumpwm has an ASDF package, load asdf (it's probably already
loaded) and run:

(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'stumpwm)

Right now the irritating :cmucl-clx name for clx in debian messes
everything up. so if you're not using debian (or you aren't using
cmucl in debian) then you need to change the dependency in stumpwm.asd
from :cmucl-clx to :clx.

You need the CLOCC ports package from http://clocc.sf.net. If you
don't have it installed, the above will fail.

For most configurations you should be able to type the following:

(stumpwm:stumpwm "" :display 0)

The first argument is the host to connect to. If you have problems
post to the mailing list.

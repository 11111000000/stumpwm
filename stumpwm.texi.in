StumpWM is an X11 window manager written entirely in Common Lisp. Its
user interface goals are similar to ratpoison's but with an emphasis on
customizability, completeness, and cushiness.

@node Starting StumpWM, Basic Usage, Introduction, Introduction
@section Starting StumpWM
There are a number of ways to start StumpWM but the most straight
forward method is as follows. This assumes you have a copy of the
StumpWM source code and are using the @samp{SBCL} Common Lisp
environment.

@enumerate
@item
Install @samp{SBCL}, the @samp{portable-clx} package, and
@samp{cl-ppcre}. In Debian, @samp{portable-clx} is the
@samp{cl-clx-sbcl} package. You can also use @samp{asdf-install} to
download and install clx:

@example
$ sbcl
* (require :asdf)
* (require :asdf-install)
* (asdf-install:install :clx)
* (asdf-install:install :cl-ppcre)
@end example

Note that asdf-install requires @samp{gnupg}.

@item
In the @file{stumpwm} directory, run @samp{./configure}.

@item
run @samp{make}. If all goes well,
this should create a @file{stumpwm} executable.

@item
In your @file{~/.xinitrc} file include the line
@command{/path/to/stumpwm}. Remember to replace @samp{/path/to/}
with the actual path.

@item
Finally, start X windows with @command{startx}. Cross your
fingers. You should see a @samp{Welcome To the Stump Window Manager}
message pop up in the upper, right corner. At this point, you have
successfully started StumpWM.
@end enumerate

@node Basic Usage, Contact the StumpWM developers, Starting StumpWM, Introduction
@section Basic Usage
Once you have StumpWM up and running, the first thing you might want
to do is start @samp{Emacs}. Type @kbd{C-t e}, or in other words
@kbd{Control + t} followed by @kbd{e}. Now perhaps you want an
@samp{xterm}. Type @kbd{C-t c}. Now you have some programs running.

To see a list of windows StumpWM is managing, type @kbd{C-t w}. The
highlighted window is the one you're looking at right now. It's the
focused window.

All of StumpWM's keys are bound to named commands, which can be
executed not only by keys but also from the input bar. Type @kbd{C-t
;} to open a command prompt. Now type @samp{time} and press
return. Note, @samp{time} can also be called by typing @kbd{C-t a}.
Throughout this manual you'll find definitions for commands,
functions, and variables. Any command you see in this manual can be
executed from the input bar or bound to a key.

At this point you probably want to switch back from your new
@samp{xterm} to @samp{Emacs}. Type @kbd{C-t C-t}. This runs the
@command{other} command. Type it again and you're back to xterm.

Perhaps you'd like to see @samp{emacs} and @samp{xterm}
side-by-side. Type @kbd{C-t s}. You have now split the screen into 2
@samp{frames}. For more information @xref{Frames}. To switch to the
empty frame type @kbd{C-t TAB}. Now let's pull the xterm window into
this empty frame. Type @kbd{C-t w} for a window listing. Find the
@samp{xterm} window. See the number beside it? Type @kbd{C-t} followed
by @samp{xterm}'s window number.

Another common activity is browsing the interwebs. Type @kbd{C-t !}.
The input bar pops up again. You can now run a shell command.  Let's
start a web browser: type @samp{firefox} into the input bar and press
return.

Unfortunately, @samp{firefox} probably isn't wide enough because it's
in one of the frames. Type @kbd{C-t Q} to remove all frames but the
current one and resize it to fit the screen.

For a full list of key bindings, @xref{List of Default Keybindings}.

@chapter Key Bindings
StumpWM is controlled entirely by keystrokes and Lisp commands. It
mimics GNU Screen's keyboard handling. StumpWM's default prefix key is
@kbd{C-t}.

@deffn {Command} escape @var{key}
Set the prefix key. Here's how you would change the prefix key to @kbd{C-z}.

@example
escape C-z

@node List of Default Keybindings, Binding Keys, Key Bindings, Key Bindings
@section List of Default Keybindings
The following is a list of keybindings.

@table @kbd
@item C-t n
@itemx C-t C-n
@itemx C-t Space
Go to the next window in the window list

@item C-t p
@itemx C-t C-p
Go to the previous window in the window list

@item C-t '
Go to a window by name

@item C-t "
Select a window from a list and focus the window.

@itemx C-t C-g
Abort the current command. This is useful if you accidentally hit @kbd{C-t}

@item C-t w
List all the windows

@item C-t 0-9
Select a window by number

@item C-t f
Select a frame by number

@item C-t s
Split current frame vertically

@item C-t S
Split current frame horizontally

@item C-t k
@itemx C-t C-k
Sends a kill message to the current frame and the running program.

@item C-t K
Kills the current frame and running program; like a kill -9.

@item C-t c
@itemx C-t C-c
Run an X terminal; by default xterm

@item C-t e
@itemx C-t C-e
Run Emacs 

@item C-t t
Sends a @key{C-t} to the frame; this is useful for applications like Firefox
which make heavy use of @key{C-t} (in Firefox's case, for opening a new
tab). This is similar to how GNU screen uses @kbd{C-a a}.

@item C-t w
@itemx C-t C-w
Prints out a list of the windows, their number, and their name.

@item C-t b
@itemx C-t C-b
Banish the mouse point to the lower right corner of the screen.

@item C-t a
@itemx C-t C-a
Display the current time and date, much like the Unix command @command{date}.

@item C-t C-t
Switch to the last window to have focus in the current frame.

@item C-t !
Prompt for a shell command to run via @file{/bin/sh}. All output is discarded.

@item C-t R
If the screen is split into multiple frames, one split will be
undone. If there is only one split, the effect will be the same as @kbd{C-t Q}.

@item C-t o
If the screen is split into multiple frames, focus shifts to the
@command{next} frame, where it cycles to the right and then down; analogous
to @kbd{C-x o} in Emacs.

@item C-t TAB
Jump to the last frame that had focus.

@item C-t F
Display ``Current Frame'' in the frame which has focus.

@item C-t ;
Opens the input box. StumpWM commands can be run from here, and the
input history moved through.

@item C-t :
Opens the input box, but all things typed in here will be sent to the
Common Lisp interpreter where they will be ran as Lisp programs; thus,
input should be valid Common Lisp.

@item C-t C-h
@itemx C-t ?
The help.

@item C-t -
Hide all frames and show the root window.

@item C-t Q
Removes all splits and maximizes the frame with focus.

@item C-t Up
@itemx C-t Down
@itemx C-t Left
@itemx C-t Right
Shift focus to an adjacent frame in the specified direction. @kbd{C-t Up} will
shift focus up, if possible, @kbd{C-t Down} will shift downwards, etc.

A map request occurs when a new or withdrawn window requests to be
mapped for the first time.

A raise request occurs when a client asks the window manager to give
an existing window focus.

@node Mode-line, Groups, Frames, Top
@chapter The Mode Line
The mode line is a bar that runs across either the top or bottom of
a head and is used to display information. By default the mode line
displays the list of windows, similar to the output C-t w produces.

Alternatively, external panel applications such as the GNOME panel and
KDE's kicker may be used. Simply starting one of these programs is enough
to set it as the mode line of the head it would like to be on (if the
panel is Xinerama aware) or whichever head is available. In order to
avoid problems displaying menus, configure your panel application for
positioning at the top or bottom of the head rather than relying on
@var{*mode-line-position*}

The mode line can be turned on and off with the @command{mode-line}
command or the lisp function @code{stumpwm:toggle-mode-line}. Each
head has its own mode line. For example:

@example
;; turn on/off the mode line for the current head only.
(stumpwm:toggle-mode-line (stumpwm:current-screen) (stumpwm:current-head))
@end example

The mode line is updated after every StumpWM command.

To display the window list and the current date on the modeline, one
might do the following:

@example
(setf stumpwm:*screen-mode-line-format*
      (list "%w | "
            '(:eval (stumpwm:run-shell-command "date" t))))
@end example

@code{(stumpwm:run-shell-command "date" t)} runs the command
@command{date} and returns its output as a string.

@deffn {Command} mode-line
A command to toggle the mode line visibility.

group will be created in the hidden state. Hidden groups have group
numbers less than one and are invisible to from gprev, gnext, and, optionally,
groups and vgroups commands.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} gnewbg @var{name}
Create a new group but do not switch to it.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} gnext
Cycle to the next group in the group list.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} gprev
Cycle to the previous group in the group list.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} gmerge @var{from-group}
Merge @var{from-group} into the current group. @var{from-group} is not deleted.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} groups @var{fmt}
Display the list of groups with their number and
name. @var{*group-format*} controls the formatting. The optional
argument @var{fmt} can be used to override the default group
formatting.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} vgroups @var{gfmt} @var{wfmt}
Like @command{groups} but also display the windows in each group. The
optional arguments @var{gfmt} and @var{fmt} can be used to override
the default group formatting and window formatting, respectively.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} gselect @var{substring}
Select the first group that starts with
@var{substring}. @var{substring} can also be a number, in which case
@command{gselect} selects the group with that number.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} gmove @var{to-group}
Move the current window to the specified group.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} gkill

StumpWM will attempt to detect Xinerama heads at startup (and at no other
time.) Heads are logically contained by screens. In a dual-monitor Xinerama
configuration, there will be one screen with two heads. Non-rectangular layouts
are supported (frames will not be created in the 'dead zone'.) And message
windows will be displayed on the current head--that is, the head to which the
currently focused frame belongs.

@end deffn

@@@ run-commands


@defmac define-stumpwm-command @var{name} ((@var{var} @var{type} @var{prompt}) ...) &body @var{body}
Create a new command with the name @var{name}. @var{prompt} is
optional. If left out, stumpwm will not prompt for the variable and it
will be set to nil.
@end defmac

@defmac define-stumpwm-type @var{type} (@var{input} @var{prompt}) &body @var{body}
Create a new type that can be used for command arguments. @var{type} can be any symbol. 

When @var{body} is evaluated @var{input} is bound to the
argument-line. It is passed to @code{argument-pop},
@code{argument-pop-rest}, etc. @var{prompt} is the prompt that should
be used when prompting the user for the argument.

@example
(define-stumpwm-type :symbol (input prompt)
 (or (find-symbol (string-upcase
		     (or (argument-pop input)
                         ;; Whitespace messes up find-symbol.
		         (string-trim " "
		           (completing-read (current-screen)
					  prompt
					  ;; find all symbols in the
					  ;;  stumpwm package.
					  (let (acc)
					    (do-symbols (s (find-package "STUMPWM"))
					      (push (string-downcase (symbol-name s)) acc))
					    acc)))
                      (throw 'error "Abort.")))
                  "STUMPWM")
     (throw 'error "Symbol not in STUMPWM package")))

(define-stumpwm-command "symbol" ((sym :symbol "Pick a symbol: "))
  (message "~a" (with-output-to-string (s)
	          (describe sym s))))
@end example

This code creates a new type called @code{:symbol} which finds the
symbol in the stumpwm package. The command @code{symbol} uses it and
then describes the symbol.

@node Hooks, Command and Function Index, Miscellaneous Commands, Top
@chapter Hooks
StumpWM exports a number of hooks you can use to add customizations;
like hooks in Emacs, you add to a hook with the @code{add-hook}
function. for example:

@example
(stumpwm:add-hook 'stumpwm:*new-window-hook* 'my-new-window-custos)
@end example

adds your @code{my-new-window-custos} function to the list of
functions called when a new window appears.

@defmac add-hook @var{hook-variable} @var{function}
Add @var{function} to the hook @var{hook-variable}. For example, to
display a message whenever you switch frames:

@example
(defun my-rad-fn (from-frame to-frame)
  (stumpwm:message "Mustard!"))

(stumpmwm:add-hook stumpwm:*focus-frame-hook* 'my-rad-fn)
@end example
@end defmac

It is not recommended you add lambda functions or function objects to
a hook as they are difficult to remove.

@defmac remove-hook @var{hook-variable} @var{function}
Remove the specified function from the hook.
@end defmac

The following hooks are available:

@defvr {Hook} *map-window-hook*
A hook called whenever a window is mapped.
@end defvr

@defvr {Hook} *unmap-window-hook*
A hook called whenever a window is withdrawn.
@end defvr

@defvr {Hook} *new-window-hook*
A hook called whenever a window is created.
@end defvr

@defvr {Hook} *destroy-window-hook*
A hook called whenever a window is destroyed.
@end defvr

@defvr {Hook} *focus-window-hook*
A hook called when a window is given focus.
@end defvr

@defvr {Hook} *unfocus-window-hook*
A hook called when a window loses focus.
@end defvr

@defvr {Hook} *start-hook*
A hook called when StumpWM starts.
@end defvr

@defvr {Hook} *internal-loop-hook*
A hook called inside StumpWM's inner loop.
@end defvr

@defvr {Hook} *focus-frame-hook*
A hook called when a frame is given focus. The hook functions are
called with 2 arguments: the current frame and the last frame.
@end defvr

@defvr {Hook} *message-hook* &rest @var{lines}
Any time a message is displayed in stumpwm this hook gets called with
the lines displayed.
@end defvr

@defvr{Hook} *new-frame-hook* @var{new-frame}
When a new frame is created, this hook is called with the new frame as an argument.
@end defvr

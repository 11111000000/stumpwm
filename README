The Stump Window Manager
------------------------

Stumpwm is a window manager written entirely in Common Lisp. It
attempts to be highly customizable while relying entirely on the
keyboard for input. You will not find buttons, icons, title bars, tool
bars, or any of the other conventional GUI widgets. 

These design decisions reflect the growing popularity of productive,
customizable lisp based systems.

Start Stumpwm
-------------

Boot up a common lisp implementation. I test it regularily with sbcl
and clisp.

Since stumpwm has an ASDF package, load asdf (it's probably already
loaded) and run:

(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'stumpwm)

For most configurations you should be able to type the following:

(stumpwm:stumpwm)

Note that you need to tell stumpwm where your X server is running
either by passing the display string to stumpwm or by setting the
DISPLAY environment variable. Stumpwm defaults to ":0". The X server
must be running before you start stumpwm.

This is the step-by-step method of loading stumpwm. The next section
describes some convenient scripts that capture the above.

Wrappers
--------

For convenience, there are 2 scripts that boot stumpwm:

stumpwm.clisp
stumpwm.sbcl

Read the comments in the scripts. You may need to specify some load
paths. Make sure they have the executable permission and you can use
them as you would a regular program. Hopefully, it's as easy as
throwing one of them in ~/.xinitrc.

For other loading methods take a look at the stumpwm wiki:
